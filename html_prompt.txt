Create a single HTML file web app for valuing European options using the Black-Scholes model. Include:

1. User Interface:
   - Input fields: underlying price, strike price, time to expiration, risk-free rate, volatility, option type (call/put)
   - "Calculate" button and result display area

2. Valuation Method:
   - European options: Black-Scholes formula

3. Outputs:
   - Option price, delta, gamma, theta, vega

4. Features:
   - Responsive design for desktop and mobile
   - Input validation and error handling
   - Caching for repeated calculations
   - Toggle between scientific and decimal notation
   - Brief explanation of the Black-Scholes model

5. Code:
   - Modern JavaScript (ES6+)
   - Well-commented, organized functions

6. Default Parameters:
   - Underlying price (S0) = 36
   - Strike price (K) = 40
   - Time to expiration (T) = 1.0 year
   - Risk-free rate (r) = 0.06
   - Volatility (sigma) = 0.2

Implement all HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in a single file, runnable entirely in-browser without external dependencies.

Create a single HTML file web app for simulating stock price paths and valuing European options. Include:

1. User Interface:
   - Input fields: initial stock price, strike price, time to expiration, risk-free rate, volatility, number of paths, number of steps
   - Option type selector (call/put)
   - "Simulate" button and result display area

2. Simulation:
   - Implement geometric Brownian motion for stock price simulation
   - Visualize simulated paths using a line chart (use a library like Chart.js)

3. Option Valuation:
   - Calculate European option prices (both call and put) based on simulated paths
   - Display option prices and 95% confidence intervals

4. Features:
   - Responsive design for desktop and mobile
   - Input validation and error handling
   - Toggle between showing all paths or just mean path
   - Brief explanation of the simulation method and option pricing

5. Code:
   - Modern JavaScript (ES6+)
   - Well-commented, organized functions

6. Default Parameters:
   - Initial stock price (S0) = 36
   - Strike price (K) = 40
   - Time to expiration (T) = 1.0 year
   - Risk-free rate (r) = 0.06
   - Volatility (sigma) = 0.2
   - Number of paths = 500
   - Number of steps = 252 (trading days in a year)

Implement all HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in a single file, runnable entirely in-browser. You may use a CDN-hosted charting library for visualization.
